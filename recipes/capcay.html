        A yummy Chinese - Indonesian vegetable dish that you'll find in the
        restaurant all over Surabaya. It's a great pescetarian dish, too. We
        usually serve it with brown rice and fried tofu. You can leave out the
        prawns and the taste is still great, or even substitute for chicken.
